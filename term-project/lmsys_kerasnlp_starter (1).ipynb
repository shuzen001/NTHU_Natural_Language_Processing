        "In this competition, our aim is to predict which LLM responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). In other words, the goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner. This notebook will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the **DebertaV3** model for this competition using the **Shared Weight** strategy with KerasNLP. This strategy is similar to how Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) models are trained. Additionally, we will use mixed precision for faster training and inference.\n",

KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of the preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).\n",

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a function in Azure Functions to retrieve data from Azure Storage Account and test the connection between Azure Functions and your React project.\\n\\n**Step 1: Create an Azure Function**\\n\\n* Go to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Function App. Choose your preferred runtime stack (Node.js, Python, C# etc.).\\n* Once the function app is created, create a new function by clicking on the \\\"+\\\" New Function button. Choose the HttpTrigger template and provide a name for your function.\\n* Replace the default code in the function with the following code:\\n```javascript\\nmodule.exports = async function (context, req) {\\n    const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure\\\\/storage-blob');\\n    const connectionString = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING;\\n    const containerName = process.env.CONTAINER_NAME;\\n    const blobName = process.env.BLOB_NAME;\\n\\n    const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);\\n    const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);\\n    const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName);\\n\\n    const response = await blockBlobClient.download(0);\\n    const content = (await streamToBuffer(response.readableStreamBody)).toString();\\n\\n    context.res = {\\n        status: 200,\\n        body: content\\n    };\\n};\\n\\nasync function streamToBuffer(readableStream) {\\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\\n        const chunks = [];\\n        readableStream.on('data', (data) => {\\n            chunks.push(data instanceof Buffer ? data : Buffer.from(data));\\n        });\\n        readableStream.on('end', () => {\\n            resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks));\\n        });\\n        readableStream.on('error', reject);\\n    });\\n}\\n```\\nThis code uses the Azure Blob Storage SDK to download the contents of a blob from Azure Storage Account. Make sure to replace `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `CONTAINER_NAME`, and `BLOB_NAME` with your own values.\\n\\n**Step 2: Set the environment variables**\\n\\n* Go to the Configuration section of your Azure Function App and add the following environment variables:\\n\\t+ `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string for your Azure Storage Account.\\n\\t+ `CONTAINER_NAME`: The name of the container where your blob is located.\\n\\t+ `BLOB_NAME`: The name of the blob you want to download.\\n\\n**Step 3: Test the Azure Function**\\n\\n* Click on the \\\"Get function URL\\\" button in the Azure Functions dashboard to get the URL for your function.\\n* Open a new browser window and navigate to the URL. You should see the contents of your blob displayed in the browser.\\n\\n**Step 4: Test the connection between Azure Functions and React**\\n\\n* In your React project, create a new component called `AzureFunctionComponent`.\\n* Inside the `AzureFunctionComponent`, create a function called `fetchData` that makes a GET request to your Azure Function URL. You can use the `fetch` API or a library like Axios to make the request.\\n* Once the data is retrieved, you can display it in your component using JSX.\\n\\nHere's an example of what the code for `AzureFunctionComponent` might look like:\\n```javascript\\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction AzureFunctionComponent() {\\n  const [data, setData] = useState('');\\n\\n  const fetchData = async () => {\\n    const response = await fetch('https:\\\\/\\\\/<your-function-url>\\\\/api\\\\/<your-function-name>');\\n    const content = await response.text();\\n    setData(content);\\n  };\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    fetchData();\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h1>Data from Azure Function:<\\\\/h1>\\n      <pre>{data}<\\\\/pre>\\n    <\\\\/div>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default AzureFunctionComponent;\\n```\\nMake sure to replace `<your-function-url>` and `<your-function-name>` with your own values.\\n\\n**Step 5: Test the React component**\\n\\n* Start your React project using\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56050,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sure!

There are reasonable arguments on both sides of this complex issue. Potential benefits of standardization could include more consistent quality, accessibility and analysis. However, excessive standardization could also reduce creativity, diversity and humanity in language. If pursued, any efforts towards standardization should be undertaken thoughtfully, with input from a diverse range of experts and stakeholders.

Satou is willing to do anything to keep Shio by her side, even if it means resorting to extreme and violent measures.\\n\\n\\\"Salt,\\\" on the other hand, represents the negative and bitter aspects of relationships, such as pain, suffering, and betrayal. Satou's life is filled with \\\"salt,\\\" as she has experienced trauma and abuse in her past, and she is struggling to cope with her emotions and desires. The people who surround Satou, such as her classmates and coworkers, also have their own \\\"salt\\\" that they carry with them, which affects their interactions and relationships with others.\\n\\nIn summary, \\\"Sugar\\\" and \\\"Salt\\\" in \\\"Happy Sugar Life\\\" are metaphors for the positive and negative aspects of human relationships. The story uses these concepts to explore the complex and often dark nature of love, obsession, and manipulation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_model_a\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_model_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_tie\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"winner_model_a\",\n          \"winner_model_b\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

At the same time, it is also important to acknowledge the biological differences between males and females.\\n\\nOne possible approach to finding a middle ground could be to focus on respecting individuals' self-identification and autonomy while also acknowledging the biological differences between males and females. This could involve using inclusive language that reflects individuals' gender identities while also recognizing the importance of biological sex in certain contexts, such as medical treatment and reproductive health.\\n\\nIt may also be helpful to explore ways to create a more inclusive society where individuals of all gender identities are valued and respected. This could involve promoting education and awareness about gender diversity and creating policies and practices that support individuals' gender identities and expression.\\n\\nUltimately, the goal of mediation is to find a solution that meets the needs and concerns of both parties. By focusing on mutual respect, open communication, and a willingness to find common ground, it is possible to reach a resolution that allows both parties to move forward in a positive and productive way.\",\n          \"When you want to initialize the classification head for transfer learning, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n  1. Load the pre-trained model: First, load the pre-trained vision transformer model on ImageNet. You can use popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow to load the model.\\n  2. Freeze the pre-trained layers: Next, you need to freeze the pre-trained layers of the model so that they don't get updated during the training process. This is because the pre-trained layers have learned useful features that can be reused for the new task.\\n  3. Add a new classification head: Now, you need to add a new classification head to the model. The classification head is responsible for outputting the predicted class for a given input image. The size of the classification head depends on the number of classes in the new task. For example, if you are working on the StanfordCars dataset, which has 196 classes, you would need a classification head with 196 output neurons.\\n  4. Initialize the classification head: Initialize the weights of the classification head randomly or using pre-trained weights. This is important because the initial weights can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.\\n  5. Train the model: Finally, you can train the model on the new task using your labeled data. During training, only the weights of the classification head will be updated, while the weights of the frozen pre-trained layers will remain unchanged. This allows the model to learn task-specific features while leveraging the pre-trained features.\\n\\nNote that there are different ways to initialize the classification head, such as using Xavier initialization, Kaiming initialization, or He initialization. You can choose the initialization method that works best for your specific task and model architecture.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"You still have three oranges. Eating an orange yesterday does not affect the number of oranges you have today.\",\n          \"Mr Reddy and Ms Blue both have valid points in their arguments. On one hand, Mr Reddy is correct that women are adult human females, as defined by their biological and physical characteristics. However, Ms Blue is right that gender is a more fluid concept and that people can identify with any gender they choose. A compromise could be that gender is defined by an individual's self-identification, while sex is defined by their biological characteristics.\",\n          \"To initialize the classification head when performing transfer learning, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Load the pre-trained vision transformer model that was trained on ImageNet.\\n2. Replace the existing classification head with a new one suitable for the StanfordCars dataset.\\n3. Initialize the weights of the new classification head with random values or pre-trained weights if available.\\n4. Freeze the weights of the vision transformer backbone to prevent them from being updated during training.\\n5. Train the model on the StanfordCars dataset, fine-tuning the classification head while keeping the backbone frozen.\\n\\nHere's an example implementation in Python using PyTorch:\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torchvision.models as models\\n\\n# Step 1: Load pre-trained vision transformer model\\nvision_transformer = models.vit_base_patch16_224(pretrained=True)\\n\\n# Step 2: Replace classification head\\nnum_classes = 196  # Number of classes in StanfordCars dataset\\nvision_transformer.head = nn.Linear(vision_transformer.head.in_features, num_classes)\\n\\n# Step 3: Initialize weights of new classification head\\nnn.init.xavier_uniform_(vision_transformer.head.weight)\\nnn.init.constant_(vision_transformer.head.bias, 0)\\n\\n# Step 4: Freeze the weights of the backbone\\nfor param in vision_transformer.parameters():\\n    param.requires_grad = False\\n\\n# Step 5: Train the model on StanfordCars dataset\\n# ...\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we load the pre-trained vision transformer model using `torchvision.models.vit_base_patch16_224`. We then replace the `head` (classification head) of the model with a new linear layer (`nn.Linear`) that has the appropriate number of output classes for the StanfordCars dataset.\\n\\nAfter replacing the classification head, we initialize its weights using Xavier initialization (`nn.init.xavier_uniform_`) and set its biases to zero (`nn.init.constant_`).\\n\\nFinally, we freeze the weights of the vision transformer backbone by setting `requires_grad=False` for all parameters. This ensures that only the weights of the classification head will be updated during training on the StanfordCars dataset.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The couple is required to meet certain criteria, such as being of a certain age or not being closely related. Once the license is issued, there's often a waiting period before the marriage ceremony can take place. The marriage license has to be signed by the couple, their witnesses, and the officiant conducting the marriage ceremony, then returned to the license issuer for recording.\\n\\n2. Marriage Certificate: A marriage certificate, on the other hand, is a document that proves a marriage has legally taken place. It's issued after the marriage ceremony, once the signed marriage license has been returned and recorded. The marriage certificate includes details about the couple, like their names, the date and location of their wedding, and the names of their witnesses. This document serves as the official record of the marriage and is often needed for legal transactions like changing a name, adding a spouse to insurance, or proving marital status.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_model_a\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_model_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_tie\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"winner_model_b\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"encode_fail\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"options\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "**What it does:** The preprocessor takes input strings and transforms them into a dictionary (`token_ids`, `padding_mask`) containing preprocessed tensors. This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n",

        "The `KerasNLP` library provides various NLP model architectures such as `Bert`, `Roberta`, `DebertaV3`, and more. While this notebook focuses on `DebertaV3`, you can explore others in the [KerasNLP documentation](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/). For a deeper understanding, refer to the [getting started guide](https://keras.io/guides/keras_nlp/getting_started/).\n",

        "Our approach utilizes `keras_nlp.models.DebertaV3Classifier` to process each prompt and response pair, generating output embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings and pass them through a Pooling layer and a classifier to obtain logits, followed by a `softmax` function for the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with multiple responses, we use a weight-sharing strategy. This means we provide the model with one response at a time along with the prompt `(P + R_A)`, `(P + R_B)`, etc., using the same model weights for all responses. After obtaining embeddings for all responses, we concatenate them and apply average pooling. Next, we use a `Linear/Dense` layer along with the `Softmax` function as the classifier for the final result. Providing all responses at once would increase text length and complicate model handling. Note that, in the classifier, we use 3 classes for `winner_model_a`, `winner_model_b`, and `draw` cases.\n",
